Key generator and an encryption/decryption program.  
Files must be in the same folder as the code to function properly.  
**How to run the code  
Step 1 -- Run the key generator to create the Encryption.key  
Step 2 -- Run the Encryption program by typing 'python Encryption_lab.py encrypt {filename}' in the console
The console should now say that the file has been successfully encrypted, and there should be a new file with .encrypted attached to it
Step 3 -- Run the decryption program by typing python 'Encryption_lab.py decrypt {filename} in the console' (Note that this should be the .encrypted filename)  
The console should now say that the file has been decrypted, and there should now be a new file with .decrypted attached to it
